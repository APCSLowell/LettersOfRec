If you would like me to write a letter of recommendation, please give me a short description of what the recommendation is for, where I should send it and when it is due. 

I like to write about what I've seen you do in my classroom. Think about your favorite programming projects, lessons, or classroom experiences. It's really helpful to me if you could write a couple sentences or so about what your favorites were and why you chose them. Also, please consider attaching screenshots that illustrate those programming assignments or class activities you are most proud of. You can see a sample letter of recommendation below that shows how I would use your screenshots. I find *print screen* and the *snipping tool* both work well in Windows for taking screenshots. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or concerns.
