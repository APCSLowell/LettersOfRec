If you would like me to write a letter of recommendation, please give me a short description of what the recommendation is for, where I should send it and when it is due. Also, please attach two or three screenshots that illustrate what assignments or class activities you are most proud of, and a short description of why you are proud of them. I've linked to a sample letter of recommendation to show you how I would use your screenshots. I find *print screen* and the *snipping tool* both work well in Windows for taking screenshots. Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions or concerns.
